== PURPOSE:
One of the primary purpose of a Business Process Management (BPM) solution is to manage the wait-state of long running business process instances.
Typically, the process instance is _signaled_ so as to re-load the process instance from its wait-state and advance it to the next node in the process definition.
Red Hat's BPM Suite 6 product includes extensive support for signaling of long running process instances in a wait-state.

The purpose of this project is to investigate and prove that the BPM Suite 6 functions properly upon receiving a REST call to complete a work item.
The steps to use this project are provided below.  If there is an error in the project, then the below step will be provided as steps to reproduce the error in 
a Bugzilla request.

:numbered:

== Assumptions
The following items are required to follow the steps below:

. BPM Suite 6 instance, version 6.0.2, installed over JBoss EAP 6.1.1
. curl - to send http requests from the command line

== To reproduce the example
For ease of reproduction, the steps of this use case are provided as curl commands.  

=== Download and install BPM Suite version 6.0.2 GA
Configure user `guest` with password `guest`. 

.Hint:
***********
- guest=b5d048a237bfd2874b6928e1f37ee15e      (application-users.properties:)
- guest=admin                                 (application-roles.properties:)
***********

Start the server.

=== Add the organizational unit
----------
curl -vv -u guest:guest -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"gpe","description":"","owner":"jboss"}' http://localhost:8080/business-central/rest/organizationalunits/
----------

=== Add the repository
----------
curl -vv -u guest:guest -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"completeWIrepo","description":"gpe","userName":"","password":"","requestType":"clone","gitURL":"https://github.com/randythomas/completeWITest.git"}' http://localhost:8080/business-central/rest/repositories
----------

=== Deploy the module
The following command deploys the project using the `PER_PROCESS_INSTANCE` runtime strategy:

----------
curl -vv -u guest:guest -X POST http://localhost:8080/business-central/rest/deployment/com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_signalling:processTier:1.0:bpmsignalling_base:bpmsignalling_session/deploy?strategy=PER_PROCESS_INSTANCE
----------

=== Start the process
----------
curl -vv -u guest:guest -X POST http://localhost:8080/business-central/rest/runtime/com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_signalling:processTier:1.0:bpmsignalling_base:bpmsignalling_session/process/processTier.concurrentPInstanceSignal/start?map_p1=5i
----------

Check the server log.  There you will find a log entry that looks similar to the following:

----------
ksessionId = 3 : pInstanceId = 1 : workItemId = 1 : p1 = 5
----------

The process instance id value and the work item id value from your output will be used in several commands below.

At this point it is helpful to query the `SessionInfo` table.  For the above example, the table contains the following:

----------
+----+----------------------+---------------------+
| id | lastModificationDate | startDate           |
+----+----------------------+---------------------+
|  1 | NULL                 | 2014-07-01 10:58:21 |
|  3 | 2014-07-01 15:25:08  | 2014-07-01 15:25:08 |
+----+----------------------+---------------------+
----------

As you would expect, the id value of the last row matches the ksessionId from the log output.

=== Complete the Work Item
In the following REST call to complete the work item, replace the work item id value of `1` with the value from your log output discussed above.

----------
curl -vv -u guest:guest -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/business-central/rest/runtime/com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_signalling:processTier:1.0:bpmsignalling_base:bpmsignalling_session/workitem/1/complete?runtimeProcInstId=2'
----------

WARNING
----------
As of version 6.0.2, the `runtimeProcInstId` parameter is missing from the product documentation.  If it is not used the following error results:
----------

**********
 WARN  [org.kie.services.remote.rest.exception.DescriptiveExceptionHandler] (http-localhost/127.0.0.1:8080-1) Exception thrown when processing request 
[/runtime/com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_signalling:processTier:1.0:bpmsignalling_base:bpmsignalling_session/workitem/112/complete]; responding with status -1: 
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Invalid session was used for this context org.kie.internal.runtime.manager.context.ProcessInstanceIdContext@6e04f404
**********

The client gets the following corresponding error message:

**********
 <status>FAILURE</status>
    <url>http://localhost:8080/business-central/rest/runtime/com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_signalling:processTier:1.0:bpmsignalling_base:bpmsignalling_session/workitem/112/complete</url>
    <message>IllegalStateException thrown with message 'Invalid session was used for this context org.kie.internal.runtime.manager.context.ProcessInstanceIdContext@6e04f404'</message>
    <stackTrace>java.lang.IllegalStateException: Invalid session was used for this context org.kie.internal.runtime.manager.context.ProcessInstanceIdContext@6e04f404
**********

If you check the sessioninfo table in the database, you will find that a new entry has been made for a new session.  In the case of this example, the following was queried:

----------
+----+----------------------+---------------------+
| id | lastModificationDate | startDate           |
+----+----------------------+---------------------+
|  1 | NULL                 | 2014-07-01 10:58:21 |
|  3 | 2014-07-01 15:25:08  | 2014-07-01 15:25:08 |
|  4 | NULL                 | 2014-07-01 15:29:37 |
+----+----------------------+---------------------+
----------

If the `runtimeProcInstId` parameter is included, then the process will complete as expected.

=== Uneploy the module
The following command undeploys the project:

----------
curl -vv -u guest:guest -X POST http://localhost:8080/business-central/rest/deployment/com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_signalling:processTier:1.0:bpmsignalling_base:bpmsignalling_session/undeploy
----------

=== Abort the Process Instance
In the advent that anything when wrong, you may have a need to about the process instance.  The following REST call can be used in this case.

In the following command, replace the `112` instance id with the `pInstanceId` from your log entry discussed above.

----------
curl -vv -u guest:guest -X POST http://localhost:8080/business-central/rest/runtime/com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_signalling:processTier:1.0:bpmsignalling_base:bpmsignalling_session/process/instance/112/abort
