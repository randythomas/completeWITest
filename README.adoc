== PURPOSE:
One of the primary purpose of a Business Process Management (BPM) solution is to manage the wait-state of long running business process instances.
Typically, the process instance is _signalled_ so as to re-load the process instance from its wait-state and advance it to the next node in the process definition.
Red Hat's BPM Suite 6 product includes extensive support for signalling of long running process instances in a wait-state.

The purpose of this reference architecture is deep-dive into the _signalling_ capabilities of BPM Suite 6.

This reference architecture includes a BPM Suite 6 _KIE project_ and {ref_arch_doc} that showcase a variety of advanced _signalling_ use-cases.
